                    Assignment in The Entrepreneurial Competition:
                </h3>
                

                    <p> 
                        The task was to come up with a business idea based on four specific categories
                        - we chose service innovation and developed a concept that creates
                        service, network and security all in a app. We also entered an online Idea Competition where we
                        pitched our concept for judges. 
                    </p>


                <h3>
                    Work process:
                </h3>

                    <p>
                        We filled in a BMC and mission template that helped describe the business idea and strategy.
                        A prototype of an app was developed in XD, that was used to test our audience to make sure it
                        matched our concept, mission and fictional future users.  
                    </p>

                    
                <h3>

                </h3>
    
                    <p>
                        My role was project management along with my co-pitcher. I ensured that all missions were
                        carried out and that order and structure were maintained. In addition, I pitched and learned
                        a lot about entrepreneurship, leadership and project management. I learned more in depth about
                        prototypes, user segments and usability testing.

                    Assignment in SoMe & Branding:
                </h3>
                
                    <p> 
                        We worked with online marketing of our product from the entrepreneurial competition,
                        and developed a sales platform. We created a prototype of a website (for mobile and desktop) that refers to
                        our prototype of an app created in Adobe Xd during the entrepreneurial competition.
                    </p>


                <h3>
                    Work process:
                </h3>

                    <p>
                        Since we already had a website to take as a starting point, the challenge was to make improvements in terms
                        of usability and appearance. In addition, it also had to be re-coded into mobile-first function.
                    </p>

                <h3>
                    What I learned:
                </h3>

                    <p>
                        My role was project manager, which meant that I again kept order and structure.
                        I was responsible for coding the front page, and making 2x content for our social media.
                        I gained a lot of new knowledge about social media and marketing. Including content creation,
                        content plans, branding, trends and tendencies etc. I also learned a lot of new stuff about HTML,
                        CSS and this time Javascript from Youtube. This was the first project we used GIT (-kraken), which
                        I also got better knowledge and understanding of.
