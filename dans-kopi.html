                Assignment in pt. 1:
            </h3>


                <p>
                    The task was to develop a website for a fictional dance school targeted at
                    a specific user segment, where we appeared as a web agency. Our first assigned
                    dance school was folk dance. 
                </p>


            <h3>
                    Work process:
            </h3>
                

                <p>
                    I made use of the development method design thinking, which set the
                    framework for the task. We also made use of qualitative
                    interviews, observations and even danced at a folk dance school.
                </p>


            <h3>
                    What I learned:
            </h3>

                <p>
                    My role was to design and code the social media page. I also aimed my focus on
                    design and Ps to gain more knowledge in the field from someone elske with more experience.
                    I learned to think and work in a new and creative way based on the design thinking
                    process and iterations. I also gained more knowledge on Ps and editing.

                    Assignment in pt. 2:
                </h3>

                    <p>
                        The task was to further develop and test a digital website
                        (mobile format first), which was prepared by another group in part 1.
                        Therefore, we were also assigned a new user segment - this time it was ballet.
                    </p>


                <h3>
                    Work process:
                </h3>

                        <p>
                            There was particular focus on visualizing iterations in the design process,
                            wireframes and mockups, and usability testing.
                        </p>


                <h3>
                    What I learned:
                </h3>

                    <p>
                        My role was to develop the “medarbejdere” page, and I was in charge of merging
                        all the pages together. I learned about user tests and their importance in the
                        design process. There was particular focus on UX and UI. I also learned a lot about
                        coding, merging, and visualising through moodboards, fonts and colors.
